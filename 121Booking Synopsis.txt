Hi Chingu team!
I’m more than happy to reverse engineer any project, work in any tech.

I wrote this up earlier this year for myself to create as a portfolio piece.
It might be an interesting to produce as a team.

It’s for hustlers that book jobs and dispatch someone. All the scheduling software they look at falls short. They need to book a job (many times its a one-shot job), who’s doing it, where, when, and confirmation that the person is on the task. Then they need to check the job details to make sure the payments were sent. No banking, just checkboxes so things can be done in cash. I saw this same pattern for talent managers, dog walking, line waiting, event vendors, promotional teams… so many things, and all of them too small to have a mobile/desktop application developed. Strikes me as a job for Open Source!
